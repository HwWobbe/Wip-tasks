## Canadian Postal Code 'hints':

Toronto is a large Canadian city that like all of Canada, has been encoded for Mail Delivery purposes.

The first letter M of a Canadian postal code is all of Toronto

The second character is a number from 1 - 9 that divides Toronto into 9 vertical bands running from East to West. So M1 is the east-most band of Toronto

The third character A-Z is a further subdivisions of the vertical bands running downwards. So M1C is the east-most, 3rd from the top, part of Toronto.

Together, the first 3 characters refer to an Area called the FSA (Forward Sortation Area).  There is a better, longer explanation of Canadian Postal Codes at WikiPedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Canada. Review this is you are interested in working with Canadian addresses.
